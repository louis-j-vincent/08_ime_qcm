      "On a quiet hill beyond the last sleepy house, there was a small meadow that only the moon seemed to remember. The grass there grew soft as a blanket, and the flowers closed their petals at night like they were tucking themselves in.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that meadow lived a unicorn named Luma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luma wasn’t the kind of unicorn who liked loud parades or shiny castles. She liked gentle things: warm breezes, slow songs of crickets, and the way the stars blinked as if they were practicing winks. Her horn glowed faintly—not bright like a lantern, but cozy like a night-light left on for comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night, Luma took a careful walk along the edge of the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not because she was afraid—unicorns aren’t easily frightened—but because the woods could get tangled with worries. Little worries, big worries, worries that followed people home and tried to climb into bed with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luma had a way of helping.\n",
      "\n",
      "She’d pause by a fern and listen. If she heard a worry—something like *What if tomorrow is hard?* or *What if I mess up?*—she would lower her head and let the tip of her horn hum a soft, silvery note. The worry would loosen, like a knot untying itself, and drift upward as a pale mist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Luma would nudge it gently toward the sky, where it could become something lighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening, the moon was round and bright, and the meadow felt extra quiet. Luma walked slowly, her hooves making the faintest sound—like someone turning a page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Near the creek, she found a very small worry sitting on a stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looked like a tiny gray puffball with a frown.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t want to bother anyone,” it sniffled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luma sat down carefully beside it, folding her legs under her like a cat in a storybook. “You’re not a bother,” she said. “You’re just heavy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The tiny worry blinked. “Am I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A little,” Luma answered kindly. “But you don’t have to stay that way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She touched her horn to the worry, and instead of humming a note, she whispered, “You’re allowed to rest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The worry trembled, as if it had never heard those words before. Then it softened. Its frown melted. Its gray became a gentle, pearly color—like fog lit by moonlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What will I be now?” it asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luma smiled. “Maybe a cloud. Maybe a dream. Maybe nothing at all. Nothing can be very peaceful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little pearly puff floated up, drifting into the sky. As it rose, it stretched into a thin ribbon and curled around a star. The star shone a bit warmer, as if it had been wrapped in a scarf.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luma watched until she couldn’t see it anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she returned to the meadow and lay down in her favorite spot—right where the grass was the softest and the earth held the day’s last bit of warmth. She tucked her tail around her hooves. Her horn’s glow dimmed to the quietest shimmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above her, the moon kept watch. The crickets played their tiny lullaby. And somewhere far away, in a bedroom, a mind felt just a little lighter—like a blanket had been adjusted perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luma closed her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meadow breathed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the whole night, gentle and steady, remembered how to be calm.\n"
